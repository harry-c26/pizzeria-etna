# Pizzeria Etna Website
Pizzeria Etna website's purpose is to improve overall awareness of the restaurant in the area to increase the number of visitors and to help it stand out from the competition. Many of the restaurants in or around Aguilas use Facebook instead of their own website. The website will allow users to find the restaurant, browse the menu and book a table.

## Testing

*  The website has been tested on chrome, edge and firefox and has the same appearance on all browsers.
*  The links all work and take you to the relevant page.
*  The website is responsive to different screen sizes and keeps a common layout on them.
*  The booking form works and will only submit when all of the fields are filled out with the correct information. 

## Validator testing

*  It has been tested on the HTML validator and has passed with 1 note regarding language when the website is set to English. As this is for menu items for an Italian restaurant I ignored this warning.
*  It has been tested on the CSS validator and has passed as well.
*  I have checked the website is responsive and functions on a variety of screen sizes using AmIResponsive as well as the inspection devtools.
*  I have also checked the site with Lighthouse which gave an overall score of 97 for accessibility.

## Bugs

### Solved bugs

* The main issue I had was the booking page having poor accessibility scoring. First I tried to adjust the code myself but none of the attempts worked so I looked online and found a fix as listed below. 

### Unfixed bugs

* There are no bugs with the site that I'm aware of. 

## Credits

### Content

* The code for the social media links was taken from the [CI Love Running project](https://github.com/harry-c26/love-running)
* To fix the contrast between the text and background image on the booking page I used the code from [here](https://coder-coder.com/background-image-opacity/)
* The code used to get the google map for the homepage was aided by [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U_AAGHzTok)
* The colours for the Italian flag in the footer came from [here](https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/italy#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20colors%20of,are%20green%2C%20white%20and%20red)
* The footer layout and styling was from the [w3schools how to site](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_three_columns.asp)
* To create the grid for the menu I used a [grid generator](https://grid.layoutit.com/) to give the base layout ready for styling and filling

### Media

* The caprese image was taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/es/photos/queso-mozzarella-ensalada-caprese-5218979/)
* The background image on the booking page was taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/landscape-bay-beach-darling-clouds-5277781/)
* All other images were provided by the owners of Pizzeria Etna.

### Others to mention

* A special thank you to Sheryl for the advice and points she gave me to look into flex box and flex grid as options for the menu page
* The [README guide](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples#credits) that Kera Cudmore put together was a great help as well 

## Further development plans

* Improve the quality of the photos on the menu page
* Add an ordering page for collections
* Expand the home page with adjustments to the about us section with images of the owners and restaurant and adding an awards section for the ones they've received from Tripadvisor.

## Things I've learned from my project

* Definitely start writing the README file at the start as part of my planning and use it as a working document.
* Breaking the page down into smaller sections and fully completing the header before moving onto the body for example. 
* Committing in smaller chunks and more often.
