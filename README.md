# Pizzeria Etna Website
Pizzeria Etna website's purpose is to improve overall awareness of the restaurant in the area to increase the number of visitors and to help it stand out from the competition. Many of the restaurants in or around Aguilas use Facebook instead of their own website. The website will allow users to find the restaurant, browse the menu and book a table.

## Testing

* The links all work and take you to the relevant page.
* The website is responsive to different screen sizes and keeps a common layout on them.
* The booking form works and will only submit when all of the fields are filled out with the correct information. 

## Validator testing

* It has been tested on the HTML validator and has passed with 1 note regarding language when the website is set to English. As this is for menu items for an Italian restaurant I ignored this warning.
* It has been tested on the CSS validator and has passed as well.
* I have checked the website is responsive and functions on a variety of screen sizes using AmIResponsive as well as the inspection devtools.
* I have also checked the site with Lighthouse which gave an overall score of 97 for accessibility.
